#### Description

> Little python 3 script, take an export file of [Revolut](https://revolut.com/) and draw some meaningfull plots using [plot.ly API](https://plot.ly/) and print some informations about the spendings.

#### How to launch it

>Place your '.csv' file into the same folder as the python script files.
>**You have to change the name of the .csv file in the script in order to use your own data !**

> `python.exe revolut_info.py`
> `python.exe revolut_spendings.py`

> After that, a folder by year would appear with the plots. They are in .html, use your favorite browser to show them.

#### TO DO List

> - write a report in a .md file.
> - compile the script

#### Known bug
> - bug for ploting the last year
> - since that there is no 'category' section in the .csv given by revolut. The script is not able to draw things 'by category'
